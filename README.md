# Yelp - What influences consumer ratings?
This projects examines the influence of specific business attributes on the consumer rating of businesses. We created a model to predict the relative impact of specific business attributes that are listed on Yelp on consumer ratings on Yelp of these business. 

## Research Motivation
In the digital age, consumer ratings and online reviews have become one of the most influential sources of information in shaping consumer expectations and purchase decisions. This means that in the increasingly competitive digital market it is critical to understand which business attributes are drivers for positive and negative consumer ratings. In order to find these attributes that are drivers of consumer rating, we exploit a large open dataset created by Yelp.

Yelp serves as a public forum where consumers can share their experiences and evaluate business. With Yelp's widespread use in the recreation industries like restaurants, retail, and services, it is one of the top online website consumers visit for a trustworthy review. The dataset of Yelp provides use with various variables (including the name, location, category, attributes, ratings, etc.) of over 150,000 businesses across the United States of America. By analyzing this data we hope to find managerial insights, that will make us understand the importance of specific business attributes for the online consumer reviews.

This research emphasizes the importance of using data to drive business decisions, rather than relying on anecdotal feedback or industry trends. This aligns with the growing trend toward data-driven marketing, where decisions are based on hard evidence rather than intuition.
